Dire warning messages are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements. You step closer to inspect it and.. wait.. did somebody just knock on the door?",
  "You advance carefully onwards, deeper into the dungeon's mysteries. You pass many different passages, some are dead ends, others seem to have no end at all. A huge metal door blocks your path.
