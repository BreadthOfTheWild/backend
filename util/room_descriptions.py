  "The forest was small, dense, and verdant. Its canopy was reigned by magnolia, hazel, and sequoia, and sparkling light dancing between the branches allowed for vibrant shrubs to take advantage of the moss covered grounds below. The only opening is to the east or back west.",

  "Thick tree limbs grasped many trees, and a variety of flowers, which grew in a sprinkled and disorderly fashion, spruced up the otherwise dark lower level. The only opening is to the east or west.",
  "A hodgepodge of wild sounds, belonging mostly to foraging animals, reverberated through the air, and formed a chaotic orchestra with the swaying of tree tops in the wind. The only opening is still to the east or west.",
  "The forest was colossal, impenetrable, and flourishing. Its canopy was ruled by hazel, juniper, and buxus, and abundant dancing lights bounced through their crowns for a flood of ferns to dominate the sloping and slanting ground below. You can only continue eastwards or back westwards.",
  "Swooping vines hung from every tree, and a variety of flowers, which desperately tried to avoid the shadows, highlighted the otherwise unvarying scenery. Why can I only go east or west?", 
  "A mixture of animal noises, most belonged to critters, added life to the forest, and drowned out the occasional roar of a large animal trying to scare away predators. Only path lies eastwards or westwards.",
  "The forest was huge, spacious, and rich. Its canopy was eclipsed by spruce, magnolia, and larch, and abundant dancing lights bounced through their crowns for a medley of herbs to grow in the moist and fertile bottom layer below. Once again, the only directions available are east or west.",

This must be where the treasure lies!"
